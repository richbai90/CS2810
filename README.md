This is the main branch for the front end code. Changes to the web app code and gui should be made here. Make sure after cloning the repo to type

`git checkout frontend` to put yourself on the correct branch. Make any changes you like, then run `git pull`, if there are no conflicts then you can simply `git push`. If there are conflicts, then do the following `git checkout -b frontend-<myname>-<mychange>`, make the change as you see fit, commit, and then type `git push --set-upstream origin frontend-<myname>-<mychange>` Make a pull request and review the code together in class.
