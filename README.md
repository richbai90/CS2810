# CS2810 -- Database

This is the main branch for the front end code. Changes to the scripts that create the database should be made here. Any changes to the database should be documented as scripts so that the backend team can keep their code up to date. Make sure after cloning the repo to type

`git checkout database` to put yourself on the correct branch. Make any changes you like, then run `git pull`, if there are no conflicts then you can simply `git push`. If there are conflicts, then do the following `git checkout -b database-<myname>-<mychange>`, make the change as you see fit, commit, and then type `git push --set-upstream origin database-<myname>-<mychange>` Make a pull request and review the code together in class.
