# CS2810 -- Backend

This is the main branch for the backend code. Changes to the server code should be made here. Make sure after cloning the repo to type

`git checkout backend` to put yourself on the correct branch. Make any changes you like, then run `git pull`, if there are no conflicts then you can simply `git push`. If there are conflicts, then do the following `git checkout -b backend-<myname>-<mychange>`, make the change as you see fit, commit, and then type `git push --set-upstream origin backend-<myname>-<mychange>` Make a pull request and review the code together in class.

# CS2810 -- Database

This is the main branch for the front end code. Changes to the scripts that create the database should be made here. Any changes to the database should be documented as scripts so that the backend team can keep their code up to date. Make sure after cloning the repo to type

`git checkout database` to put yourself on the correct branch. Make any changes you like, then run `git pull`, if there are no conflicts then you can simply `git push`. If there are conflicts, then do the following `git checkout -b database-<myname>-<mychange>`, make the change as you see fit, commit, and then type `git push --set-upstream origin database-<myname>-<mychange>` Make a pull request and review the code together in class.

# CS2810 - Arduino
This is the repo for the Arduino code. Changes to the Arduino libraries and main code should go here. Make sure to run `git checkout arduino` after cloning the repo, to make certain you are on the correct branch. Make whatever changes and run `git pull`. If there are no conflicts, simply run `git push`, otherwise run `git checkout -b arduino-<myname>-<mychange>`. Make whatever changes necessary, commit, and run the following command `git push --set-upstream origin arduino-<myname>-<mychange>`

# CS2810 -- PI

This is the main branch for the PI code. Changes to PI libraries, and main code should be made here. Make sure after cloning the repo to type

`git checkout pi` to put yourself on the correct branch. Make any changes you like, then run `git pull`, if there are no conflicts then you can simply `git push`. If there are conflicts, then do the following `git checkout -b pi-<myname>-<mychange>`, make the change as you see fit, commit, and then type `git push --set-upstream origin pi-<myname>-<mychange>` Make a pull request and review the code together in class.
